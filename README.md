# Security+ Notes

This repository contains my personal notes, summaries, and study materials while preparing for the **CompTIA Security+ SY0-701** certification.

## 📘 Organization Method
The structure of these notes follows the learning flow from the  
**“Get Certified Get Ahead – CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 Study Guide” by Gibson & Shelley**.

I chose to organize my notes according to this book rather than the standard CompTIA domain order because it provides:
- A clearer progression of concepts
- Better topic grouping
- More logical sequencing for beginners
- Stronger reinforcement through practical examples
